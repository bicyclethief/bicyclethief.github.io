      <div class="article-body">
          <h2>What is pair programming?</h2>
          <p>Pair programming is a collabortive software development effort beteween two people.
         Together, the pair is able to intensify focus, speed and ability to solve problems in a better way. This is achieved by dividing up into two major roles, the driver and the navigator.</p>
          <h2>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h2>
          <p>Pair programming has numerous benefits to students at DBC.
              Perhaps the most important is the early and continuous exposure to other students'
              work habits, work flow, coding techniques, etc. Another benefit is acclimating future programmers to working collaboratively: the culture, the communication, etc.

          Pairing this time was good. (I yet to have a bad experience, actually.) I had actually "paired" with my partner before to figure out a git problem, so this wasn't a completely "blind" pairing. So that easied my comfort. Regardless, even if we had never spoken before, I'm sure our session would have been just as smooth and productive, knowing her easy-going, friendly personality. My partner and I both vocalized a gap in our CSS knowledge: we both were not completely confident about it. But with practical tips and suggestions from our Guide, I think we both are more confident about the learning competencies, especially CSS.

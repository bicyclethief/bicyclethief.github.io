      Remember that training scene in The Karate Kid? No, not the one with Jaden Smith. The 1984 original with Ralph Macchio. Mr. Miyagi takes Daniel-san outside to the parking lot of cars and tells him: First wash. Then wax: wax on, left hand, wax on, right hand. Daniel-san had to do this for each and every car in the lot.
    </p>
    <p>Next day, to the backyard deck with hand-held sanders: Right circle. Left circle. Right circle. Left circle. BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT. Daniel-san had to do this for each and every wooden plank on the deck. </p>

    <p>And finally, a day later, to the fence (both sides!) with a paintbrush: Wrist up. Wrist down. Up. Down. DON'T FORGET TO BREATHE. For every wooden board of the fence, Daniel-san did this.
    <p>

    <p>Thus was the Karate Kid's now-legendary training: a set of karate instructions, unbeknownst to Daniel-san, done for each and every object in a collection: cars in a parking lot, wooden planks of a backyard deck, and wooden boards of a fence.

    <p>As you well know, after his training, Daniel-san goes on to win the tournament, got his leg swept, won the respect of his enemies, the heart of a girl, and the pride of his teacher-- with a crane kick or two thrown in there. That's the story we love, but there's a dirty secret that no one likes to talk about: Mr. Miyagi got Daniel-san to do a bunch of awesome stuff on his collection of things for free.</p>

    <p>In Ruby, you are Mr. Miyagi and <code>Enumerable</code> is your Karate Kid. And you too can make <code>Enumerable</code> do a bunch of awesome stuff for you on your collection of things. Ruby's <code>Enumerable</code> methods will apply your set of instructions-- or block of code, in Ruby lingo-- to each object in your collection. Instead of the cars in a parking lot or anything like that, your collections will likely be the objects in an <code>Array</code> or <code>Hash</code>. And that's the simple conceptual idea behind Ruby's <code>Enumerable</code>.</p>

    <p>Let's look at one specific method: <code>Enumerable#map</code>. I think of <code>map</code> as the transformational <code>Enumerable</code> method, capable of transforming each and every object in the collection. And as we've learned from the makeovers on <i>The Jenny Jones Show</i>, transformations can be powerful. For example, what if we had an array of a million numbers and wanted to add 7 to every one? A million numbers to increase is no joke. But with <code>Enumerable#map</code> it totally is! Below is an example of <code>Enumerable#map</code> in full effect:
    </p>

<!--     <pre>
      big_array = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 23, 5, 7, 2, 4, -1, 34, 0, 77]

      big_array.map { |number| number + 7 }
      => [9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 30, 12, 14, 9, 11, 6, 41, 7, 84]
    </pre>
 -->
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/bicyclethief/7b1c9c1c2dd2bc338bce.js?footer=0"></script>

    <p>Okay, that's not an array of a million numbers (that would make for a very long blog post). But the principle is the same: <code>Enumerable#map</code> would apply the instruction-- <code>number + 7</code>, in this case-- to each and every number in the array, whether it's fourteen as shown or a million. On any type of Ruby collection. However big your collection. No mercy! Let's see Daniel-san do that.</p>

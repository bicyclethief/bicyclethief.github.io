<h1>Git Busy Livin' or Git Busy Dyin'</h1>
<h2>Version Control, Git, and Github</h2>

  If life had version control, we might not know regret. Unless you have some gadget I don't know about, we all get one, linear version-- and that's it.

When I was a kid, one summer, I worked at Chuck E Cheese. On the job, they would rotate you to different roles every so often: front door greeter, pizza maker, video game manager, and even being Chuck E Cheese. (They did this so you wouldn't get bored, I guess, because you could mindless do any of these.) Being Chuck E Cheese was the worst. I had to wear this heavy furry costume with a big fake mouse head. It was hot inside and you couldn't see all that well out of the eye holes. Little screaming kids hyped up on soda or because it was their birthday ran around you and tugged at you. Worse, you couldn't say a single thing while you were in costume because Chuck E didn't talk, you see, and you had to stay in character. But the worst part was the smell. That's because after each use, the costume didn't get put in the washer or anything. It was just sprayed down with Lysol and hung up for the next poor sap whose turn it was to be Chuck E Cheese. The first minimum wage job you chose as a kid: that's one I wish I had back.

If I could go back to that summer, I would maybe show a little more ambition, you know? Like spending the summer writing, learning to become the next great American novelist, or Ruby inventor. But there's no takebacks in life, really. If life had version control, there might not be such a thing as regret! No this is not guerilla marketing for Hot Tub Time Machine 2. It's my ham-handed attempt at illustrating version control. Because if life had Git, a version control software, I could rollback to that fateful summer, spend those careless days chipping away on an old typewriter or Commodore 64 instead of having filled out that worksheet that was to be my Chuck E. Cheese application. With Git and other version control software, one can take a "snapshot" of it and revisit it if the current version doesn't work out. Not with life, of course, but with digital documents and, more commonly, source code. Which is nice, because code is very ethereal-- it can be easily lost. Besides the time-travel aspect, Git manages collaboration. In the real world, especially in the workplace, teams of people are often working together, with the same common files, simultaneously. Git directs traffic so that one person's contribution doesn't clobber someone else's.

GitHub is website that can host your Git repositories, the stuff you want to keep versions of. Because it's on the internet, your digital stuff and its versions can be powerfully accessible, particularly for collaborators. It's like the mothership for repositories.

    <p>I don't think Stereotype Threat has impacted my achievement, at least not academically. If anything, expectations have reverse hurt me. Why can't I get grades more like my cousins, my mom was oft to opine. Mom! I'm not a rocket surgeon, I said, but she doesn't listen. She and my dad were both teachers in Vietnam: she taught English, and he, Math. They wanted me ahead of the school curriculum here, so they had their own homework for me to do after I finished with the school's. In eight grade, this resulted in me being shuttled off everyday in a short, yellow bus to a nearby high school (with a rough rep) for math. That was probably terrifying. Luckily, I wasn't too terribly self-aware yet. See? The negative impacts of expectations. In all seriousness I'm lucky to have had high expectations pressed upon me that I couldn't meet rather than low ones undermining my potential.</p>

    <p>For Asian Americans, there may be a different sort of Stereotype Threat. Much has been written of the lack of diversity in the tech industry, but little of it spotlights Asian Americans. While Asian Americans make up a large percentage of tech workforce, "<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/07/07/328206747/asian-american-leadership-programs-tackle-the-bamboo-ceiling">when it comes to leadership roles, their demographic shrinks, along with those of other minorities</a>": the so-called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling">bamboo-ceiling</a>". Apparently, according to <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/employment/jobpat-eeo1/2006/national.html">government statistics</a>, Asian Americans have the lowest chance of ascending to management when compared with Blacks, Latinos, and Women in spite of having the highest educational attainment. Personally, I can't say I've ever experienced the "bamboo ceiling", but then I've never really been ambitious in that way.</p>

    <p>But I have felt the invisible hand of stereotypes in some other ways. And I can tell you: it's one thing for a single person to doubt or exclude you-- this is pretty easy to shrug off-- but when it's some large, indistinct group that does, it can feel debilitating. However, I'm not one to dwell on such negative, corrosive things. I'm a fairly self-possessed person, so to me, this just increases my odds of pleasantly surprising people.</p>

    <p>What can I or others do to help those suffering under the specter of Stereotype Threat? First and fundamentally, I think one has to truly, deeply believe in everyone's potential. Otherwise, I feel like your thoughts and actions will betray even the best of intentions. Another obvious way to mitigate Stereotype Threat, I think, is to continually push and expect more achievement from a person no matter what they've accomplished. If low expectations undercut a person and sow seeds of doubt, high expectations will hopefully diminish and counteract those effects. Another approach I believe in-- and this may seem counter-intuitive-- is to withhold praise during work. (This is something I fail miserably at. Not only do I praise, but sometimes I gush.) The idea is not to link achievement with extrinsic things, like a teacher's approval, but to the intrinsic: like the joy of discovery or the pride of perseverance. My hope would be that internal motivation, self-desire, blunts the external ill effects of Stereotype Threat. (It should be noted, however, that <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct07/vol65/num02/The-Perils-and-Promises-of-Praise.aspx">research from Carol Dweck</a>-- of the Fixed vs Growth Mindset-- showed that praise of intelligence is detrimental while praise of effort is actually beneficial.)</p>

    <p>P.S. Shit. Reading over my post, it looks like I've basically recommended Tiger Mom strategies. Damn you, mom and dad. And thank you, mom and dad.</p>
